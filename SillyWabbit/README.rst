Playing with Wabbit
===================

This project implements a compiler for a small language called Wabbit.
This directory is a playground where you can try the language
and write some small programs.  

There are three programs here: prog1.wb, progwb.g, progwb.g.  You can go to 
each program and follow the instructions inside. You can run each program
using the provided program `wabbit.py`.  For example:

   $ python3 wabbit.py prog1.wb
   ... see the output ...

The `wabbit.py` program is running each program in an interpreter
which is sort of similar to the compiler theis projcet implements
except that everything runs a lot slower.
